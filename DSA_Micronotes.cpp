GRAPH:
   1) a)  The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph whereas Floyd-Warshall computes shortest paths from each node to every other node.
      b)  Note: whenever question says pre-requisite or to complete some task before some task use topological sort

    2) a) Traveling SalesMan Problem uses below concept
          The Hamiltoninan cycle problem is to find if there exist a tour that visits
          every city exactly once. Here we know that Hamiltonian Tour exists (because
          the graph is complete) and in fact many such tours exist, the problem is to
          find a minimum weight Hamiltonian Cycle.
          problem:
          given cities and dist. between each pair of cities,
          find the shortest possible path that visits each cities and return to origin city

       d) check negative cycle in graph
            use belman ford algo

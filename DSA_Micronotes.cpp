GRAPH:

  a)  The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph whereas Floyd-Warshall computes shortest paths from each node to every other node.
   b)  Note: whenever question says pre-requisite or to complete some task before some task use topological sort
